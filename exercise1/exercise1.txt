Make the following models. Use the LTSA tool to try out your models.

1. Give the FSP process description of the following
LTS graph

   tick     tick       tick
0 ----->  1 ------> 2 ------> 3


2. Write the FSP process of a coffee machine, where
you can either enter a one euro coin and request coffee
once, or enter a two euro coin, and request coffee twice.
After that the machine is ready to start again.
Give 2 different prefixes (starts) of example traces of 
length 4.


3. Write the FSP process of a normal dice. Once the dice
has been thrown, it gives a value from 1 to 6. Then it can
be thrown again.


4. Write the FSP process of a coffee machine, which
sells coffee (1 e), espresso (2 e), and latte (3 e).
It accepts coins of 1 e and 2 e up to a value of 4 e.
If the value would go over 4 e, it returns the coin.
Once there is money in the machine, it is possible to
get a drink, in which case the money returns the excess money.
(If the money is not enough for a drink requested, then "nothing"
happens - no drink is produced and no money is returned).


5. Same as 4, but the excess money is not returned - instead
the machine can be used to get more drinks or more money
can be insterted.


6. In addition to 5, define a customer process, which randomly
either
- inserts a 1 e coin
- inserts a 2 e coin
- tries to get a coffee
- tries to get an espresso
- tries to get a latte.
Make a parallel composition of the customer and the coffee
machine of exercise 5.
