3.1 Continuing from Exercise 2.2, make a safety property
that states that the reading the account amount should
be followed by a write by the same user. Test your property
with the solution of Exercise 2.2. and Exercise 2.3.


3.2. Consider the following shop:
CUSTOMER=(wait->CUSTOMER|service->CUSTOMER).
SHOPKEEPER=(service->SHOPKEEPER).
||SHOP=(p[1..3]:CUSTOMER||{p[1..3]}::SHOPKEEPER).
Using priority and progress statement, show that the
shop is not necessarily fair in the sense that everyone
would eventually get service.


3.3. Add queue numbers to the shop in such a way that
each customer takes a queue number, then waits for her number, 
and then buys, and then goes on to take a new number to buy again. 
Check progress.


3.4. Change the book's fair single line bridge in such a way that
it always allows 3 cars of each color to cross before it changes
the turn.
