1.
Make an FSP model, where there is a bank account and a customer. The
account starts from 0 euros/whatever currency. The customer can either
save 1 euro or withdraw 1 euro from the account. No need to care if
the account goes below 0. Do not model anything not needed (like
the reads and writes, that come into the picture in the next assignment).


2. 
Now change the model in such a way that there are two customers,
and the account just does reads and writes like the VAR at the
Ornamental Garden. Check that your model allows incorrect computation.


3. Add locks to the model, like in the ornamental garden, to
disallow incorrect behaviour.


4. Add timeouts to the model. If a process tries to get a lock
and cannot do it, it can also timeout and start over.
